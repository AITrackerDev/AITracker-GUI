ABOUT
AITracker is a neural network designed to determine the direction of where you are looking with just a simple webcam. This application is designed to be an all-in-one place where you can connect to any hardware with GPIO pins. This application is designed to be used with the Adafruit FT23H breakout board, although the source code is available on GitHub for anyone to add functionality to.
LAUNCH
This is where the application is used. Each of the boxes shown on screen are the current inputs being tracked (as determined by the settings). When an input is detected, the box will change color to indicate as such. These boxes are also used as a landmark so you have an idea where to look for that input.
SETTINGS
This is where the application can be configured to the needs of your use case. Each setting block refers to one specific output of the program (eg. "Up" refers to what happens when you look up). The switch indicates if the application will track that input, the entry box refers to which pin should be turned on on the FT23H board, and the check box refers to if the input will be an on/off switch (eg. looking in that direction will turn the pin on, and stay on until you look in that direction again). The "Look Duration" setting will refer to how long the user will have to look in any direction for that input to be recognized.
