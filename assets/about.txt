Eye tracking technology has typically been limited by the necessity for expensive and specialized hardware. However, the AITracker project aims to revolutionize this field by introducing an affordable and accessible alternative. This project presents a vision for an innovative webcam-based eye tracking system that utilizes deep learning algorithms to accurately detect eye movements in real-time. The primary objective of AITracker is to provide users with a seamless and intuitive interface for controlling and interacting with external devices using only their eyes. By leveraging the capabilities of deep learning, the software can precisely track eye movements in eight directions (up, down, left, right, up left, up right, down left, and down right) as well as detect blinks, effectively transforming a standard webcam into a powerful input device.

Despite challenges related to data collection for AI training and optimization of algorithms, the project aims to achieve the highest attainable accuracy, with potential for further improvement. With an emphasis on user-friendliness and accessibility, AITracker is designed to run on standard laptops with minimal system requirements, making it widely available to users. In conclusion, the AITracker project represents a significant advancement in eye tracking technology, offering an affordable and versatile solution with broad applications in various different fields. From determining screen-time to hardware integration, the applications of the project are wide-reaching in both the hardware and software spaces. This project aims to not only be a complete solution for hardware integration, but a solid starting point for developers to build upon the network for their specific applications.
